# Danil's Web Development Playground

Hi there! My name is Danil (they/them) and I'm a web development enthusiast from Cherkassy, Ukraine. I'm currently learning the exciting world of building websites and applications. This GitHub Pages project serves as my playground to experiment, practice, and showcase my progress.

My favorite color, in case you were wondering, is blue! 

This repository contains the files for my website. Feel free to explore the code and learn alongside me!

**Let's Connect!**

**Stay tuned!**

As I continue learning and building, this repository will be updated with new projects and creations. 

I'm excited to be on this journey and I look forward to sharing my progress with you!
