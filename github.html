            <h1>What is GitHub?</h1>
            <p><strong>GitHub</strong> is a web-based platform for version control and collaborative software development. It allows developers to store, manage, track, and control changes to their codebase in a repository. GitHub leverages Git, a powerful distributed version control system, to help developers work together on projects from anywhere in the world.</p>

            <h2>Key Features of GitHub</h2>

            <h3>Repositories</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Repository (Repo):</strong> A storage space where your project lives. It can contain files, folders, and even other repositories.</li>
                <li><strong>Public and Private Repos:</strong> GitHub offers both public and private repositories, allowing users to share their work openly or restrict access as needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Forks:</strong> Create a personal copy of a repository to experiment with changes without affecting the original project.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Version Control with Git</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Git:</strong> The underlying version control system used by GitHub. It tracks changes, allows for branching, and enables merging of code.</li>
                <li><strong>Commits:</strong> Snapshots of your project at specific points in time. Every change is saved with a message describing what was altered.</li>
                <li><strong>Branches:</strong> Allow parallel development and experimentation. Branches can be merged back into the main codebase after review.</li>
                <li><strong>Tags:</strong> Labels that mark specific points in your repository’s history, often used to indicate releases.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Collaboration</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pull Requests (PRs):</strong> A method of submitting contributions to a project. A PR allows you to propose changes, discuss them, and merge them into the main branch after review.</li>
                <li><strong>Issues:</strong> GitHub's tracking tool for bugs, enhancements, tasks, and other to-dos. They are a great way to keep track of what needs to be done on a project.</li>
                <li><strong>Discussions:</strong> A feature for community conversations about a project. Discussions are a place to ask questions, share ideas, and engage with other users.</li>
                <li><strong>Projects:</strong> GitHub’s project management tool for organizing and tracking work within repositories. You can create boards, add tasks, and track progress.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>GitHub Actions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>CI/CD:</strong> GitHub Actions enables Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) directly in your repository. Automate tests, builds, and deployments with workflows defined in YAML files.</li>
                <li><strong>Custom Actions:</strong> Create and share reusable actions to simplify complex workflows.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>GitHub Pages</h3>
            <p>A feature that allows you to host websites directly from a GitHub repository. It's often used for documentation, personal blogs, and project websites. Pages can be customized using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and can be served from the root or from a separate branch.</p>

            <h3>Security</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dependabot:</strong> Automated dependency updates to keep your project secure by notifying you about vulnerabilities and suggesting fixes.</li>
                <li><strong>Code Scanning:</strong> Automatically analyze your code for potential security vulnerabilities and enforce security policies.</li>
                <li><strong>Secret Scanning:</strong> Detects accidentally committed secrets in your codebase and alerts you to remove them before they are exposed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Community and Social Coding</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Forking:</strong> Creating a personal copy of another user’s repository. This is essential for contributing to open-source projects or starting a new project based on an existing one.</li>
                <li><strong>Stars:</strong> Bookmarking repositories for later reference, similar to a "like" system. Stars help showcase popular or useful repositories.</li>
                <li><strong>Followers:</strong> Just like on social networks, users can follow other users to keep up with their activity. It’s a way to stay updated on the work of others you find interesting.</li>
                <li><strong>GitHub Sponsors:</strong> Support open-source contributors and projects by providing financial sponsorship.</li>
            </ul>
