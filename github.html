    <h1>What is GitHub?</h1>
    <p><strong>GitHub</strong> is a web-based platform for version control and collaborative software development. It allows developers to store, manage, track, and control changes to their codebase in a repository. GitHub leverages Git, a powerful distributed version control system, to help developers work together on projects from anywhere in the world.</p>

    <h2>Key Features of GitHub</h2>
    <h3>Repositories</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Repository (Repo):</strong> A storage space where your project lives. It can contain files, folders, and even other repositories.</li>
        <li><strong>Public and Private Repos:</strong> GitHub offers both public and private repositories, allowing users to share their work openly or restrict access as needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Version Control with Git</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Git:</strong> The underlying version control system used by GitHub. It tracks changes, allows for branching, and enables merging of code.</li>
        <li><strong>Commits:</strong> Snapshots of your project at specific points in time. Every change is saved with a message describing what was altered.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Collaboration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Branches:</strong> Different lines of development within a repository. They allow multiple people to work on the same project without interfering with each other's work.</li>
        <li><strong>Pull Requests (PRs):</strong> A method of submitting contributions to a project. A PR allows you to propose changes, discuss them, and merge them into the main branch after review.</li>
        <li><strong>Issues:</strong> GitHub's tracking tool for bugs, enhancements, tasks, and other to-dos. They are a great way to keep track of what needs to be done on a project.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>GitHub Actions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>CI/CD:</strong> GitHub Actions enables Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) directly in your repository. You can automate tests, builds, and deployments.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>GitHub Pages</h3>
    <p>A feature that allows you to host websites directly from a GitHub repository. It's often used for documentation or project websites.</p>

    <h3>Security</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dependabot:</strong> Automated dependency updates to keep your project secure.</li>
        <li><strong>Code Scanning:</strong> Automatically analyze your code for potential security vulnerabilities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Community and Social Coding</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Forking:</strong> Creating a personal copy of another userâ€™s repository. This is essential for contributing to open-source projects.</li>
        <li><strong>Stars:</strong> Bookmarking repositories for later reference, similar to a "like" system.</li>
        <li><strong>Followers:</strong> Just like on social networks, users can follow other users to keep up with their activity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Use GitHub?</h2>
    <p>GitHub is the largest host of open-source projects. Developers from all over the world collaborate on projects, contributing code, reporting issues, and improving documentation. Some benefits include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Open Source Collaboration:</strong> Work with a global community on open-source projects.</li>
        <li><strong>Project Management:</strong> Utilize tools like project boards, milestones, and integrations.</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Maintain comprehensive documentation alongside your code.</li>
        <li><strong>Community:</strong> Engage with a community of developers to share knowledge and contribute.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Getting Started with GitHub</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Sign Up:</strong> Create a free GitHub account.</li>
        <li><strong>Create a Repository:</strong> Start by creating a new repository for your project.</li>
        <li><strong>Clone the Repository:</strong> Clone it to your local machine to start working on it.</li>
        <li><strong>Commit and Push:</strong> Make changes, commit them with meaningful messages, and push them back to GitHub.</li>
        <li><strong>Collaborate:</strong> Invite others to contribute, or start contributing to existing repositories.</li>
    </ol>
